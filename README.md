## Features

- **Product Listing**: Displays detailed product information, including:
  - Article Name
  - Available Colors
  - Retail Price
  - Product Images
- **Filtering**: Users can filter the product list by:
  - Price
  - Color
- **Image Carousel**: Scrollable, horizontal carousel for multiple product images (front, back, flat, outfit).
- **Dynamic Color Selection**: Selecting a different color updates the displayed product image to reflect the chosen variant.
- **Wishlist & Cart Functionality**: Users can add/remove products from the wishlist or shopping cart, with interactive icons reflecting the current status.

## Technical Stack

- **React Native with TypeScript**: Provides type safety and robust development practices for scalable code.
- **TypeScript ESLint**: Integrated ESLint with TypeScript for code linting and enforcing best practices across the codebase.
- **Expo**: Used for cross-platform development, testing, and deployment on both iOS and Android.
- **REST API (Mocked)**: Simulated API to fetch product data for the application.
- **Local JSON Server**: Utilized to serve product data locally, making it easy to mock and manage API responses during development.
- **Lazy Loading of Images**: Product images are lazily loaded using expo-image, ensuring optimal performance by only loading images as they enter the viewport.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The application is optimized for both Android and iOS.

## Test Coverage

- Implemented unit tests for critical components and features, achieving good code coverage. The tests ensure reliable behavior for:
  - Product display
  - Filtering logic
  - Wishlist & Cart functionality

## Future Improvements

- Achieving Better Code Coverage with Enhanced Test Cases ðŸ’»ðŸ’»: Expand unit and integration tests to cover more scenarios, edge cases, and complex interactions, ensuring higher reliability and stability.
